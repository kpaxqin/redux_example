# Redux example

Try to show you how to build a REAL project with `React + Redux` by cover Following things:

* Basic components.
* Route, navigator and breadcrumb
* How to deal with form with sync and async validation.
* Modal: render in context, but isolate the open state.
* Error handling: setup a default way to handle error like response failure, also allow you to customize the behaviour for some special case.
* Loading, just like error handling, it's another type of `aspect` in front-end. we want to use it everywhere with out duplicated code, and the flexibility to by-pass or customize it.
* Map: integrate with non-react lib.
* Auth: control the render of component by user's authority
* CI: lint -> unit test -> e2e test
